Since beginning the Flatiron School Full Stack developer program I have started to play a little game:

Lets be honest - the Ask A Question* feature on Learn.co is great!  you're coding and you inevitably hit a wall, *within a few minutes* you have a technical coach asking you questions hopefully resulting in a swift resolution to whatever problem you face and an explaination leading to greater understanding of challenging topics.

However, sometimes there is a brief period of time where the coachs are busy and one is left waiting for a few minutes. In those times I have started to see if I can find the answer before talking with the the coach. I try to accomplish this through two means: 1. furiously googling (and command+F) 2. going back to previous lessons or code I have written in past labs to try to find either the solution to the problem I am facing on a blog or documentation and to refine the problem for myself and the coaches. 

This practice is helpful in a couple of ways: 

1. I am developing keen search skills!
2. Learning how to refine the scope of and how to describe a problem
3. making life easier on the technical coaches
4. learning how to talk about code and about the bugs I encounter

As great as the AAQ feature is I know I will not always have it, I want to be as best prepared as I can be to think quickly and independently about problems, because they will always be there. I want to learn what works best for me and develop confidence in my own probllem solving abilities. 


* The ask a question feature is a built in feature that allows students to chat and/or screenshare with a technical coach within just a few minutes. The coaches are great at explaining difficult topics and helping form a resolution by asking leading questions to pull on the knowledge the student already has.
