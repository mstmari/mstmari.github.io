My name is Michael I grew up in Asheville, NC and my wife and I currently live in Greenville, SC. I am a passionate person with many interests and hobbies. I have traveled pretty extensively, including three months volunteering in Uganda. And most recently, my wife and I just returned from backpacking through France. I am passionate about a lot of things; plants, food, typography and all things design. But the thing that love the most is connecting with people over common interests and getting to know what is important to them.

For the last year I was pursuing a master’s degree in Architecture at Clemson University, I had a lifelong dream to go to Architecture school, I worked very hard to be accepted into some of the top programs in the country. While I was at Clemson I had a job managing the website for the School of Architecture, I was required to learn HTML and CSS though I mostly used their content management system. After I got a hang of things, I was hooked! spending my free time learning code tricks and seeing what code snippets I could get to work on their CMS.  After my first year of school, I had some doubts as to whether I was in the right line of study. At just about the same time, my wife was accepted into a highly competitive master’s program. Thus, I decided to leave architecture school to support her in her educational journey. I would like to do that by learning to code and working as a developer. 

This past summer they even gave me a job building web pages and helping them restructure their web site. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to be a part of a user journey study on the site. I learned about issues pertaining to accessibility and usability in web design and communication. Over this summer, I have completed about half of the front end engineering course on FreeCodeCamp (up through object oriented programming) and am currently reading Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke. I have nearly completed my first month at Flatiron school, I am learning so much and enjoying the challenges that come with learning tocode - each day I am excited to take on a new challenge.
