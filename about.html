<p>
My name is Michael I grew up in Asheville, NC and my wife and I currently live in Greenville, SC. I am a passionate person with many interests and hobbies. I have traveled pretty extensively, including three months volunteering in Uganda. Most recently, my wife and I just returned from backpacking through France. I am passionate about a lot of things; plants, food, typography and all things design. But the thing that love the most is connecting with people over common interests and getting to know what is important to them.</p>
